This is a my_blog sample app used for posting blog posts built via node.js 
following an untidy basic approach that is without templating.
here we simply wrote the html code in res.send command.
A far better approach using templates which enhances the readability of the code .
templating can be done in various ways i.e. using 
ejs(EMBEDDED JAVASCRIPT)
hbs(HANDLEBARS)
etc..
